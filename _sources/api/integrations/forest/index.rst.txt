.. py:class:: ForestSimulator(device_name: str, seed: int = None, nthreads: int = 1)

   Bases: :py:obj:`orquestra.quantum.api.backend.QuantumSimulator`

   Simulator capable of computing exact wavefunction.

   Note that in contrast to non-simulator QuantumBackends, simulators
   are capable of simulating operations that are not natively supported
   by libraries/services they wrap. Therefore, simulation of a circuit may
   get broken into several smaller circuits. Each native circuit run
   using the wrapped library or service counts towards number_of_circuits
   run and number_of_jobs_run. However, if simulated circuit comprises only
   natively supported operation AND concrete implementation does not change
   counting methodology, each simulated circuit corresponds to an increase
   of both those numbers by one.

   .. py:method:: run_circuit_and_measure(self, circuit: orquestra.quantum.circuits.Circuit, n_samples: int) -> orquestra.quantum.measurements.Measurements

      Run a circuit and measure a certain number of bitstrings. Note: the number
      of bitstrings measured is derived from self.n_samples

      :param circuit: the circuit to prepare the state
      :param n_samples: The number of samples to measure.

      :returns: a list of bitstrings (a list of tuples)


   .. py:method:: get_exact_expectation_values(self, circuit: orquestra.quantum.circuits.Circuit, qubit_operator: orquestra.quantum.openfermion.ops.SymbolicOperator) -> orquestra.quantum.measurements.ExpectationValues

      Calculates the expectation values for given operator, based on the exact
      quantum state produced by circuit.

      :param circuit: quantum circuit to be executed.
      :param operator: Operator for which we calculate the expectation value.
