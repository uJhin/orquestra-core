   Bases: :py:obj:`opt.api.problem.Problem`

   Solves the graph partitioning problem for undirected, unweighted graph using
   an ising model formulation.

   The solution of a graph partitioning  problem is the set of nodes S that minimizes
   the weight of the edges between S and the rest of the graph. S must contain half
   the nodes in the graph.

   From "Ising formulations of many NP problems" by A. Lucas, page 6, eqs 7-9
   (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1302.5843.pdf).
