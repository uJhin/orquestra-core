   Bases: :py:obj:`opt.api.problem.Problem`

   Solves max cut problem on an undirected weighted graph using an ising model
   formulation.

   The solution of a maxcut problem is the set of nodes S that maximizes the
   wieght of the edges connecting the nodes in S to the rest of the graph.

   Cut Problem" eq. 1 (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08419.pdf).
